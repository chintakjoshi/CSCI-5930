# Introduction

I am writing this blog as a part of assignment. I am going to show you the step by step process of installing the Ushahidi project on ubuntu linux on a virtual machine.

## First of all, Can you install an open source hypervisor? Also, Why Ubuntu linux? 
Yes, One of the most chosen open source hypervisor is VirtualBox. It is an open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization, now owned by Oracle. It's lightweight, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of guest operating systems. It's a great choice for desktop users looking for a simple virtual machine solution. As we talk about choosing Ubuntu, Linux distributions come in various flavors, each with their distinctive features and use-cases. So why did I end up choosing Ubuntu? The primary reasons were its robustness, easy user interface, and extensive community support.

## Installing Virtual Machine

**Step 1**

Visit [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and downlaod the Oracle VM VirtualBox setup. Then, Go to the downloads folder and double click the .exe file and install the virtualbox on your system. Open the application and click on new. There you will write the name of your virtual system ```ubuntu``` and select the iso file you downloaded. Incase you do no have the file. I am attaching the link [Download Ubuntu ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). I am attaching some screenshots while setting up the ubuntu on virtual machine.

It will take 15-20 minutes to install ubuntu. After installing ubuntu go ahead and sign in with the password which you kept during the setup.

Now, **Step 2 - Installing Docker, Make and Git**

First go to terminal and type,

```
sudo apt-get update
```

First, let's install Docker. We need to set up the repository. Therefore, open the terminal window and type the following commands:

1. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

2. Add Docker's official GPG key:
```
 sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
 sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

3. Use the following command to set up the repository:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

**Now, we are going to install docker engine**

1. To install the latest version, run:
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

2. Now let's Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

3. Also, we need to install Docker Compose. Therefore:
```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

4. Next, set the correct permissions so that the docker-compose command is executable:
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

5. To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:
```
docker-compose --version
```
Youâ€™ll see output similar to this:
```
Output
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

**Installing Make**

1. Type the following command on your terminal window:
```
sudo apt install make
```

2. Verify that if it's properly installed or not.
```
make -version
```

You should be able to see something like this:

**Atlast, installing GIT**

1. Type the following command on your terminal window:
```
sudo apt install git
```

2. Verify that if it's properly installed or not.
```
git --version
```

## Deploying the Ushahidi Project.

First of all, Clone the ![Ushahidi project repository](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform). Then ```cd platform``` and run the command ```make start```. Now, the backend server installation will be initialized and will run on ```localhost:8080```.

The Installation process should look like this:
