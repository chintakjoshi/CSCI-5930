# Introduction

I am writing this blog as a part of assignment. I am going to show you the step by step process of installing the Ushahidi project on ubuntu linux on a virtual machine.

## Fist of all, Can you install an open source hypervisor? Also, Why Ubuntu linux? 
Yes, One of the most chosen open source hypervisor is VirtualBox. It is an open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization, now owned by Oracle. It's lightweight, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of guest operating systems. It's a great choice for desktop users looking for a simple virtual machine solution. As we talk about choosing Ubuntu, Linux distributions come in various flavors, each with their distinctive features and use-cases. So why did I end up choosing Ubuntu? The primary reasons were its robustness, easy user interface, and extensive community support.
