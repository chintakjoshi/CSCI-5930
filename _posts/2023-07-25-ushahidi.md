# Introduction

I am writing this blog as a part of assignment. I am going to show you the step by step process of installing the Ushahidi project on ubuntu linux on a virtual machine.

## First of all, Can you install an open source hypervisor? Also, Why Ubuntu linux? 
Yes, One of the most chosen open source hypervisor is VirtualBox. It is an open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization, now owned by Oracle. It's lightweight, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of guest operating systems. It's a great choice for desktop users looking for a simple virtual machine solution. As we talk about choosing Ubuntu, Linux distributions come in various flavors, each with their distinctive features and use-cases. So why did I end up choosing Ubuntu? The primary reasons were its robustness, easy user interface, and extensive community support.

## Installing Virtual Machine

**Step 1**

Visit [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and downlaod the Oracle VM VirtualBox setup. Then, Go to the downloads folder and double click the .exe file and install the virtualbox on your system. Open the application and click on new. There you will write the name of your virtual system ```ubuntu``` and select the iso file you downloaded. Incase you do no have the file. I am attaching the link [Download Ubuntu ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). I am attaching some screenshots while setting up the ubuntu on virtual machine.
