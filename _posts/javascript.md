JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting 
language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.During my bachelor's I liked working on UI design.
However, I did not know how to make such responsive pages like instagram and many famous websites. I recently got to know that these particular applications work on 
Javascript and that peaked my interest in learning this language. Hence, I begin my journey to learn JavaScript and its libraries that will help me create 
such responsive and beautiful pages in the future.
