During my sixth week, I continued my project which I started in my week four. I have added email and password live validation to the page. So that, A user can create a secure valid and secure account on the web application. So I have defined three variables const for verification ```emailE1```, ```passwordE1```, ```confirmPasswordE1```.

Creating a user registration form is an essential feature of most web applications. One of the critical parts of this process is validating the user's input data, such as their email and password, to ensure that it meets certain criteria. In this blog post, we will discuss the challenges I faced while developing a user registration form and the solutions I found to overcome them.

The first challenge I faced was creating a function that could validate the user's email address. To do this, I had to ensure that the email was not blank and that it followed a specific format. I solved this problem by creating a regular expression that matched a standard email format. The ```isEmailValid``` function uses this regex to check if the email entered by the user is valid or not.

```
const isEmailValid = (email) => {
    const re = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(email);
};
```
The second challenge I faced was ensuring that the user's password was secure. To do this, I had to check that the password contained at least eight characters, including one uppercase character, one lowercase character, one number, and one special character. I used a regex to match these criteria, which was implemented in the ```isPasswordSecure``` function.

```
const isPasswordSecure = (password) => {
    const re = new RegExp("^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#\$%\^&\*])(?=.{8,})");
    return re.test(password);
};
```
The third challenge was validating the confirm password field. The user should be asked to enter their password twice, and I had to ensure that the entered passwords matched. To do this, I created a separate function called ```checkConfirmPassword```. This function compared the password and confirm password fields and returned a Boolean indicating whether they matched or not.

```
const checkConfirmPassword = () => {
    let valid = false;
    // check confirm password
    const confirmPassword = confirmPasswordEl.value.trim();
    const password = passwordEl.value.trim();

    if (!isRequired(confirmPassword)) {
        showError(confirmPasswordEl, 'Please enter the password again');
    } else if (password !== confirmPassword) {
        showError(confirmPasswordEl, 'The password does not match');
    } else {
        showSuccess(confirmPasswordEl);
        valid = true;
    }

    return valid;
};
```
Finally, I had to create functions to show error messages when the input data was incorrect or incomplete. I used the ```showError``` function to highlight the input field with an error message when the input data was incorrect. Conversely, the ```showSuccess``` function highlighted the input field when the input data was valid.

In conclusion, developing a user registration form involves validating the input data, such as the email and password, to ensure that they meet specific criteria. I faced several challenges while developing this form, including creating functions to validate the email, password, and confirm password fields and displaying error messages. However, by using regex and applying the appropriate functions, I was able to overcome these challenges and create a functional user registration form.
