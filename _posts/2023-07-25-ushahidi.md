# Overview

This blog post, prepared as part of an assignment, details the step-by-step procedure to install the Ushahidi project on an Ubuntu Linux system within a virtual machine.

## Can I install an open-source hypervisor? Why should I choose Ubuntu Linux?
Yes, VirtualBox is a popular open-source hypervisor choice. Owned by Oracle, this lightweight and user-friendly hypervisor supports a wide range of guest operating systems, ideal for desktop users requiring a straightforward virtual machine solution.

As for Ubuntu, Linux distributions are available in numerous versions, each with their unique features and uses. Ubuntu was chosen due to its robustness, intuitive user interface, and extensive community support.

## Virtual Machine Installation

**Step 1**

Head to the [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download the Oracle VM VirtualBox setup. Navigate to the downloads folder, double-click the .exe file, and install VirtualBox on your system. Launch the application and click on 'new'. Name your virtual system 'ubuntu' and select the ISO file you downloaded. If you don't have the file, use this link to Download [Ubuntu ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Screenshots of the Ubuntu setup process on the virtual machine are provided below.

**Now, onto Step 2 - Docker, Make, and Git Installation**

Start by opening the terminal and typing:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

The Docker installation process starts with setting up the repository. Use the terminal window to execute the following commands:

1. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

2. Add Docker's official GPG key:
```
 sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
 sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

3. Use the following command to set up the repository:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

**Now, let's install the Docker engine**

1. To install the latest version, run:
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

2. Now let's Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

3. Also, we need to install Docker Compose. Therefore:
```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

4. Next, set the correct permissions so that the docker-compose command is executable:
```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

5. To verify that the installation was successful, you can run:
```
docker-compose --version
```
The output should look like this:
```
Output
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

**Install Make**

1. Execute the following command in your terminal window:
```
sudo apt install make
```

2. Verify if the installation is successful.
```
make -version
```

The terminal should display something like this:

**Finally, install Git**

1. Execute the following command in your terminal window:
```
sudo apt install git
```

2. Verify that if it's properly installed or not.
```
git --version
```

## Deploying the Ushahidi Project.

### Intializing Backend.

Firstly, clone the [Ushahidi project repository](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform). Then, navigate into the repository by typing ```cd platform``` and start the installation by typing ```make start```. The backend server will then begin to install and will run on ```localhost:8080```.

The Installation process should look like this:

To stop the backend server, type ```make stop```, which will terminate the server.

### Intializing Front-end Web project.

Clone the [platform-client-mzima repository](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform-client-mzima). Then, navigate into the repository by typing ```cd platform-client-mzima``` and type ```npm run web:serve```. _Note: You must have Node.js installed on your system. If not, follow this installation guide._

If you encounter the following error while running the command:
```
chintak@chintak:~/Desktop/platform-client-mzima$ npm run web:serve

> mzima-client@0.0.0 web:serve
> nx serve web-mzima-client

sh: 1: nx: not found
```

Then type, ```sudo npm install -g nx``` and retype ```npm run web:serve```.

The compilation should look like this:

Once it appears as in the above image, open the webserver ```localhost:4200/``` on a web browser.

Your screen should look like this:
