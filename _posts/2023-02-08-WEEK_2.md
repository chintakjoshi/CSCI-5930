In my week 2, I learned types of loops and arrays in deep. I learned do_while loops, ForEach loops, loops in array, while loop, and also how to push, pop, shift, and unshift. I learned how to add, remove, shift and unshift items in an array. I practiced the loops using couple of examples. I have added some examples of push, pop, shift and unshift. 

```
// Initialize an array
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

// Use the push() method to add an element to the end of the array
fruits.push("Kiwi");
console.log(fruits);

// Use the pop() method to remove the last element from the array
fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits);

// Use the shift() method to remove the first element from the array
fruits.shift();
console.log(fruits);

// Use the unshift() method to add an element to the beginning of the array
fruits.unshift("Strawberry");
console.log(fruits);
```
As you can see in the above example, I have listed an array of fruits in which I have pushed a fruit named Kiwi and printed it. On the other hand, To remove an item from the array I have used pop command and it will remove the first item from the array.
