JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is commonly used for front-end web development. It is used to create interactive elements on websites such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and responsive user interfaces.

In my coming weeks, I will learn more about JavaScript specific features, such as functions, events, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
